#assumptions:
## shear centre coincides with centroid
## two-dimensional flow

#Needed variables
## dCL/drareletter (XFOIL)
## dCM0/drareletter (XFOIL)
## density & velocity (cruise & sea level)
## surface area (database)
## chord @ aileron (chord function)
## K = GJ
## e = distance c/4 and shear center (geometry)
## G
## J
